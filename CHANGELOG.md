# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Notes
- Automated docker builds on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) were set up.
  Thus, you can now simply deploy flirror via its
  [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/felixedel/flirror).
  The tag `latest` always contains the latest master state. For each release a
  dedicated tag with the release version will be available (e.g. `1.0.0`).

### Fixes
- Added missing gunicorn depedency.

## 1.0.0
